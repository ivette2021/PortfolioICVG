        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>
          Hello! I am a passionate Android developer in constant evolution. My
          journey in the world of technology began with a background in
          automation and robotics engineering, providing me with a solid
          foundation in logic and problem-solving. My inclination towards
          biotechnology has also taught me the importance of precision and
          attention to detail. <br /><br />

          In my quest for knowledge, I have expanded my skill set to include UX
          design and web design. I have also gained knowledge of Unity (C#) for
          the development of my thesis. This diversity of knowledge allows me to
          create comprehensive solutions that combine functionality and
          aesthetics. My passion for art is reflected in my ability to design
          attractive and user-friendly interfaces. <br /><br />

          I consider myself a highly organized and autonomous individual. I have
          the ability to take initiative, and working independently has made me
          accountable to myself and committed to meeting deadlines. My
          perseverance has allowed me to overcome challenges and learn from
          every experience.
